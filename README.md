# Introduction

Made for **Magnetis**' designers, developers, product managers, data analysts, data scientists, stakeholders and enthusiasts, **Astro** helps us protect the brand concepts, elevate consistency in the user experience and increase the speed and efficiency of how we design and build products for our costumers.

# Manifesto

We believe that a good user experience is built with **consistent design**, well defined **visual and interaction patterns**, carefully built **emotions** and **made for all**.
Therefore, Astro is essentially:

## Atomic
Astro is built based on **Atomic Design**, so our designers and developers can use its style set and components to enhance our product interface, as a **modular system** that can be easily **managed and updated**.

## Open
Magnetis believes that good design and experiences can **impact the product market and society itself**. Our **design and code assets are open** so we can contribute to the community, help new product teams and our designers and developers can easily reach our assets from anywhere, anytime. 

## Accessible
Design is meant to be **for all**. Astro style and components follow basic recommendations from the **WCAG 2.0 guidelines** for accessibility, with tested contrast ratios and good practices in legibility.
